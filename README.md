# NOESIS II: Predicting Responses, Identifying Success, and Managing Complexity in Task-Oriented Dialogue

Building on the success of DSTC 7 Track 1 (NOESIS: Noetic End-to-End Response Selection Challenge), we propose an extension of the task, incorporating new elements that are vital for the creation of a deployed task-oriented dialogue system. Specifically, we add three new dimensions to the challenge: 
1.  conversations with more than 2 participants
2.  predicting whether a dialogue has solved the problem yet,
3. handling multiple simultaneous conversations. 
Each of these adds an exciting new dimension and brings the task closer to the creation of systems able to handle the complexity of real-world conversation.
